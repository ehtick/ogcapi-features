[big]*i.     Abstract*

OGC API Standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web API implementations in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the API building blocks.

OGC API - Features Standard defines building blocks to create, modify and query features on the Web. The OGC API - Features Standard is comprised of multiple parts. Each part is a separate standard.

The OGC API - Features - Part 5: Schemas Standard (hereafter also referred to as "this Standard" or "this document") specifies how geospatial data such as features can be described by a logical schema and how such schemas are published in an OGC Web API implementation.

As logical schemas, the schemas describe the data independent of a particular format to represent the data. 

To use a schema for data validation, the schema must be converted into a schema representation suitable for validating data in the specific data format. For example, an XML Schema that is a GML application schema or a JSON Schema for GeoJSON or the draft OGC Features and Geometries JSON (JSON-FG).

While the schema is a logical schema, a machine-readable representation is needed. Instead of specifying a custom schema language for geospatial data, this Standard uses JSON Schema as the schema language with: 

* Extensions for additional aspects that are common in geospatial data; and 
* Recommendations for restricting the use of JSON Schema capabilities in order to simplify parsing a schema.

That is, JSON Schema is primarily used as a data description language.

The main reasons for using JSON Schema are:

* Web developers are often familiar with JSON Schema and JSON;
* JSON data types (string, number, boolean, array, object, null) are simple and easy to understand; and
* JSON is often used for encoding geospatial data, i.e., the schema of a property can be used to validate property values without conversion.

NOTE: A proposal exists for a new specification link:https://github.com/json-structure[JSON Structure] that could eventually be more directly applicable for the scope of this Standard and, if approved, be used in a future revision of this Standard.

This Standard specifies <<rc_schemas,basic provisions for schemas that are applicable to any type of geospatial data>> as well as <<rc_references,provisions for references to other resources>>. These provisions are not specific to features and as such could be moved to OGC API - Common in the future.

Additional provisions are added for <<rc_core-roles-features,schemas for feature data>>.

In OGC Web APIs, geospatial data is shared in collections (path `/collections/{collectionId}`). The schema of items in a collection provides information as to how to interact with the collection. 

Examples of interactions, where information about the schema are required, include:

* An application that wants to fetch data often needs information about the properties included in the data to process, present, or store the data properly ("returnable" properties or "Returnables").
* An application that wants to fetch data restricted to a subset of the available properties needs the list of the properties in the data (again, "returnable" properties or "Returnables").
* An application that wants to fetch a subset of the data needs information about the properties that can be used to filter the data ("queryable" properties or "Queryables").
* An application that wants to fetch data in a specific order needs information about the properties that can be used to sort the data ("sortable" properties or "Sortables").
* An application that wants to create or update data needs information about the required or acceptable properties of the data ("receivable" properties or "Receivables").

This Standard specifies the schema resources listed in Table 1 to support these interactions.

Finally, 

- the <<rc_profile-parameter,query parameter `profile`>> is specified to support requesting variations in the representation of data in the same feature format, depending on the intended use of the data;
- <<rc_profile-references,three profiles are specified how to encode a reference to another resource>>: by the `resourceId` of the referenced resource, by its URI, or as a web link;
- <<rc_profile-codelists,two profiles are specified for representing values from a codelist>>: as a choice of simple schemas with a constant value or as enums with a reference to the codelist resource; and
- <<rc_profile-domains,two profiles are specified for representing value domains>>: either the values that are valid in general or the values that are currently used in the data.
