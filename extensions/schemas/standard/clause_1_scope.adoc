== Scope

This Standard specifies:

* Logical schemas describing geospatial data, for example, the properties of the features in a feature collection;
* API building blocks related to such schemas for use in OGC Web APIs;
* Profiles for representing properties that are references to other resources; and
* Profiles for representing codelists and value domains in schemas.
